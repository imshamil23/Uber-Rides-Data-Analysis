# Meachine Learning Project 2:

                            ## Uber Rides Data Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes Uber rides data to uncover insights and patterns related to ride durations, prices, and usage trends. By utilizing Python and various data visualization libraries, the project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Uber ride behaviors.

## Dataset Overview

### Description

The dataset used for this analysis contains various details about Uber rides, including:
- Date of the ride
- Time of the ride
- Pickup and dropoff locations
- Ride duration
- Ride price

### Example Data

| Start Time            | Stop Time             | Purpose   | Start Location | Stop Location  | Miles |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| 1/1/2016 21:11        | 1/1/2016 21:17        | Business   | Fort Pierce    | Fort Pierce    | 5.1   |
| 1/2/2016 1:25         | 1/2/2016 1:37         | Business   | Fort Pierce    | Fort Pierce    | TBD   |

### Purpose

The project aims to:
- Analyze ride price distributions.
- Identify peak times and locations for Uber rides.
- Explore factors affecting ride durations and prices.

## Project Goals

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and analyze the data to identify trends and patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features for deeper insights.
4. **Data Modeling** (if applicable): Build predictive models to estimate ride prices or durations.
5. **Conclusion**: Summarize findings and provide recommendations.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning (if applicable).
